  [C]When I get older [F]I will be

  [C]When I get older [F]I will be

  like a waving [C]flag

  <Verse>

  [C]born to a throne
  [G]stronger than Rome
  [Am]but violent prone
  [G]poor people zone
  [F]but it's my home
  [C]all I have known
  [F]where I got grown
  [G]streets we would roam
  
  [C]out of the darkness
  [G]I came the farthest
  [Am]among the hardest [G]survivin'
  [F]learn from these streets
  [C]it can be bleak
  [F]accept no defeet
  [G]surrender retreat
  (so we [C]struggling) [G]fighting to eat
  (and we [Am]wondering) [G]when we will be free
  so we [F]patiently wait
  for [C]that fateful day
  it's [F]not far away
  but [G]for now we say
  
  
  <Chorus>
  
  [C]when I get older [F]I will be
  stronger [Am]they'll call me freedom [G]just

  and then it goes [G]back
  (ahhho ahhho ahhho)
  
  
  <Verse>
  
  [C]so many wars
  [G]settling scores
  [Am]bring us promises
  [G]leaving us poor
  [F]I heard them say
  [C]love is the way
  [F]love is the answer
  [G]that's what they say
  
  but [C]look how they treat us
  [G]make us believers
  [Am]we fight their battles
  [G]then they deceive us
  [F]try to control us
  [C]they couldn't hold us
  [F]'cause we just move forward
  [G]like buffalo soldiers
  (but we [C]strugglin') [G]fighting to eat
  (and we [Am]wondering) [G]when we will be free
  so we [F]patiently wait
  for [C]that faithfully day
  it's [F]not far away
  but [G]for now we say
  
  
  <Chorus>
  
  [C]when I get older [F]I will be
  stronger [Am]they'll call me freedom [G]just
  like a wavin' [C]flag
  and then it goes [F]back
